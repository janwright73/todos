# todos
This exercise is a ToDo list application built with React.  The input field provides the user with the ablity to add items to the list.  Clicking on an item in the list allows the user to remove it from the view.


This project demonstrates the following concepts: 
- use of React state
- project file organization for different functional components


I had fun learning how to use formik for input field requirements in a React application.

### How to Run
Anyone can run this file by downloading the repository, running a local file server like node http-server


### Future Improvements
Add different styling to the todo list.
